# ThreadBare

Threadbare is the bootstrap app for all Thread Isomorphic applications. It hides the building and compiling logic whilst also making it re-usable and easy to update to support the ever changing javascript toolchain.


## Getting Started

Add the dependency:

`yarn add threadbare`

Run the install script:

`yarn threadbare install`

You will then be populated with the skeleton of an application to work with.

### Developing your app

Run:

`yarn dev`

This will provide you with a running, auto-reloading server with build pipeline.

### Building your app

Run:

`yarn build`

This will provide the minified bundle files into your public directory ready to be served.
